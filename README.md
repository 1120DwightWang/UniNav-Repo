# UniNav-Repo
This is where I stored my codes for creating UniNav, a web application to find QS top50 universities in the world. 
The app was deployed on heroku, click the following link to the main page: https://secret-castle-83303.herokuapp.com/

Before running "node app.js", make you that you have ran "npm install" to get the node_modules first.
